      "text": "This device consists of a grating at the top, a funnel, and a small tank. Placed in the floor of a factory, it provides additional safety by collecting spilled liquids like Diesel, Petrol/Gazoline, Creosote, and other hazardous fluids. Small gauges on the sides indicate the tank fill level. The tank material can withstand hot liquids like lava."

Using a comparator you can determine the fill level (0 empty, 15 full).$(br)When collecting flowing fluids, $(t:To prevent wasting server performance, the device has a tendency -with random reset- to collect source blocks around the last collected location.)the liquid is traced back to its next topmost source block$(), which will be removed.$(br)Digging down next to a Nether lava lake and placing a funnel, a 'crater' of flowing lava will be slowly formed. Also long 'lavafalls' can be removed by placing a funnel underneath."
