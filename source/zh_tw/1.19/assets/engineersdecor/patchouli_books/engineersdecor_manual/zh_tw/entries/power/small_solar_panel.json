The power output is enabled after it is at least 20% charged, and will remain active until the capacitor is empty again. Hence, the output of the panel pulsed.$(br)To use the panel efficiently, place a capacitor or battery underneath it. To increase the total power production you need to place a whole solar field with power transfer infrastructure."

Further efficiency factors are weather and local light conditions.$(br2)The output power over 24h is comparable to a Thermo-Electric Generator.$(br2)In summary, it is free power that also can be bumped up a bit, but you have to invest in the infrastructure, and you"
